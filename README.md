# NFC Readability tester

## Description
This hardware/software moves an NFC inlay (or an NFC Ring) over a mobile phone and locates where the NFC Antenna sweet spot is.  The co-ordinates are then stored in a database (in the format x,y,successOrFail[bool]) and can be used to identify how well a specific target device (such as a cell phone or tablet) will function with an NFC Ring.

## What problems does this solve?
Q. Does my [Insert one of a 3000 NFC handsets here] work with the NFC Ring?

A. We will be able to visually show which point each ring will work with the NFC Ring on the specific device.
